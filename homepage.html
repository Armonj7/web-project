                <p>Hi! I'm Armon Jackson, I am originally from Florida and I moved to Washington state. <br>I attended Saint Martin's University for a highly rated program named Washington Vet 2 Tech.</p>
                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>I have always taken an interest in Technology but I never knew about how vast it was or what it is that I would even do. Over the years, after I separated from the military, I have had the opportunity to work on web development projects while attending a Tech program and its something I never knew that I'd enjoy doing.</p>
                <p>My journey has been marked by obstacles, twists and turns but nothing happens by coincidence and that has been true for me throughout my life! Everything decision that I made has lead me where I am today and I wouldn't change it for the world.</p>
